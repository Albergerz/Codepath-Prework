       - the ability to join communities via button that is available on the explore page or when you enter the subreddit
    
## Notes

-Since this is my very first time using xcode I had major issues locating the correct buttons to open certain windows or files.

-I've really only coded using python so the swift syntax was difficult to understand

-Trying to figure out the UI functions of Swift like how to specify the label's text color using code. I just couldn't figure it out 

-Also i have never really dealt with code that has multiple files, even though we only used two files it was still a bit confusing

-Along with the internal xcode struggles I had just recently got a macbook so I can work on xcode, and I have never used a mac so I had to get used to navigating the system.

-I am also very new to using github so understanding repositories and navigating around the hub was difficult. Luckily the video tutorial that was included helped me

- I would like to build an app that connects with your friends similar to discord but involves a gaming aspect. Lets say you have a group of friends and you all want to play and or talk with each other then my app would have a voice chat and that has a library of games you all can play as a group while on a call. I would like to include facetime integration, chat integration, and simple mobile games that can be played as a group. I would also want to include screen sharing and very clear, not cluttered, UI.
