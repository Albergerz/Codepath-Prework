## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

       - the ability to remove all text on screen and profile pics using the clear display button
       
Spotify - how it implements vertical and horizontal scrolling in its homepage
        
        - the fluidity and resolution of the thumbnails of songs as they move

Reddit - how it is able to show you personalized post based on your previous searches
       
       - the ability to join communities via button that is available on the explore page or when you enter the subreddit
    
## Notes

-Since this is my very first time using xcode I had major issues locating the correct buttons to open certain windows or files.
-I've really only coded using python so the swift syntax was difficult to understand
-Trying to figure out the UI functions of Swift like how to specify the label's text color using code. I just couldn't figure it out 
-Also i have never really dealt with code that has multiple files, even though we only used two files it was still a bit confusing
-Along with the internal xcode struggles I had just recently got a macbook so I can work on xcode, and I have never used a mac so I had to get used to navigating the system.
-I am also very new to using github so understanding repositories and navigating around the hub was difficult. Luckily the video tutorial that was included helped me
